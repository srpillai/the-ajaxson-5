<!--  
This Launchcode unit-3 assaignement addresses one of the classic problems in computer science of how to 
optimally implement a web page that displays GIFs of the Jackson 5.

The basic goal of this module will be to fetch a GIF from Giphy, and then insert it into the DOM to 
display it on your page. We'll get into the details shortly, but first, let's play with Giphy for a minute.


The main Goals of this project:

- The main page  should provide the user with a form where she can type a search query:

- Upon submitting the form, the user should briefly see an indication that something awesome is about to happen: “Loading” for example.

- After a little while, the user should see a GIF appear!

- If the user clicks the button again, even with the same search term, a new request should be sent, yielding a (probably) new GIF.

- The gif should ideally be relevant to both the user's search term ("dance" in this case) and the Jackson 5 (or at least Michael), but depending on the search term, and just luck-of-the-draw, you might find that only one or the other could be satisfied.

- Finally, it is possible that something might go wrong in the process of making the request. If so, you should report an error to the user, like “No GIF for you”
